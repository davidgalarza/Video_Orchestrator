# Vidgen Studio — inherited interface, refined

## Direction

Operate mode. Retain the upstream's charcoal editing workspace, pale primary controls, Lucide icons and project navigation. Refine the existing world for general video editing: legible Spanish, a preview-led editor and a visible storyboard. Dark surroundings let video contrast be assessed without a bright UI competing with it.

## Foundations

System sans-serif. Body 14px; labels 12–13px; page headings 28–36px. Neutral charcoal surfaces (#101113, #17181b, #202226), pale text (#f3f3f5), secondary text (#a8abb3). Restrained warm-white primary actions. Sage marks successful saves; amber indicates unresolved tasks. No decorative gradients or glowing borders.

## Layout and states

Desktop: 224px navigation, flexible preview/storyboard, 344px scene inspector. Below 1100px, navigation collapses. The individual clip modal uses separate configuration and preview panels on mobile, with a persistent action footer and internal scrolling. Settings are a page with a return action to the current clip. Visible focus, labelled controls, reduced-motion support, meaningful empty states and inline recovery actions are required.

## Workflow

Start from a blank project. The home screen provides projects, search and creation directly, without templates or a marketing introduction. Projects open as a clip library with search, filters, selection and original ZIP downloads. Individual clip generation and editing open in a focused native modal with prompt, references, preview and versions; no storyboard or montage actions. Closing restores the clip library and preserves drafts. The optional sequence uses its own saved subset and order, with an explicit return to the library. Draft before generating. Keep generation, editing and extension distinct; preserve prior versions. A sequential queue stays at app level while changing views. Persist operation identifiers for explicit recovery after a reload. Save media as blobs and create fresh object URLs for playback.

Place the prompt and output settings before optional references. Preserve edit and extension instructions with the clip, and allow other clips to be prepared while generation runs. Selection actions explain hidden selections. Failed or interrupted clips can be filtered and recovered directly. Deletion moves clips into a persistent trash with Undo and Restore, including versions and their previous sequence position.

References distinguish opening/closing frames from up to three visual guides for characters, objects and style. Each slot opens a shared visual picker with uncropped thumbnails, search, enlarged previews and explicit confirmation. Upload by button or drop, keep uploaded images in the reference library for reuse, and explain the three-guide limit at the point of selection. Cancel leaves the clip selection unchanged. A closing frame requires an opening frame; removing the opening frame clears both. Nested dialogs restore focus without dismissing the clip editor.

Submitting from the clip modal closes it after requests are saved to the queue. The footer offers a clip count. Each output has its own library card; editing and extension create derived clips with a source link and preserve the original. Extension explains the full output duration before submission. Legacy grouped results can be explicitly separated into independent clips. Library cards show the provider's actual phase, clip index and waiting count. A global queue control remains available across projects, with pause and explicit continuation after reload. Generation runs sequentially while drafting and queue submission stay available; no invented progress percentage.

Review work stays in the library: stars mark favorites, discarded clips have their own recoverable filter, and selected pairs or a derived clip with its source can be compared with shared playback and seeking. Reusing a clip opens an editable draft before any request. Download preparation exposes scope, safe filename previews and optional metadata. Queue management stays behind an optional Activity panel; automatic processing needs no extra decisions. The panel offers only next-turn priority, cancellation and recovery, with the active request protected from cancellation of waiting clips.

Downloads keep Original as the default and offer 720p, 1080p and 4K with actual source/output dimensions for individual clips. The same choice appears in clip cards, the editor, the video library, ZIP preparation and sequence export. Describe local Lanczos scaling honestly, preserve the source, and distinguish enlarged resolution from recovered detail. Show processing progress and cancellation without exposing encoder parameters. Resolution suffixes distinguish prepared files; source generation metadata stays separate from download metadata.

The montage is a dedicated single-track editor: source library, aspect-correct preview, selected-clip inspector and a proportional, zoomable timeline. Adding, reordering, trimming both edges, splitting, duplicating and removing are non-destructive. Each occurrence pins its source generation and saves in/out times and volume independently. Use decoded video durations for timing; block preview/export for unavailable sources. Preview seeks without rendering and preloads the next clip. Export applies the same cuts, volume and framing. Preserve legacy montage order and restore every occurrence on trash recovery. Offer buttons and numeric fields alongside drag operations, local undo/redo, visible save status and recoverable saving failures.

Sequence refinement: focus view uses the viewport with visible transport controls and scrollable side panels; background navigation becomes inert until exit. On phones the order is viewer, timeline, then switchable library/inspector. Selection preserves the playhead within the current take. Show real, cached representative filmstrip images instead of extra live timeline videos, an explicit before/after drop indicator, source audition, cut-to-cursor controls and temporary selected-take looping. Volume gestures create one undo entry. Keep hover/focus feedback restrained and key bindings discoverable.
